# Objective

We are aiming to predict the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) with a lead time of 30 days an accuracy above 50%. The group is currently working on two strands:

1. Training a vision transformer (ViT) network
2. Fine-tuning the Microsoft Aurora 1.3B parameter foundation model

I am responsible for undertaking work on this second strand.
